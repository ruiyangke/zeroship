//! A THEMED test binary. Every `mod` below was its own `tests/*.rs` integration
//! target until the whole directory was regrouped; each one statically linked its
//! own copy of the crate. Declaring them here makes them modules of ONE binary.
//! Nothing about the tests themselves changed - a `mod` missing from this list is a
//! test that silently stops running, so the list is the load-bearing part of the file.
